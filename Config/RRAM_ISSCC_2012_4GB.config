; Based on Panasonic's 2012 ISSC paper 
;    An 8Mb Multi-Layered Cross-Point ReRAM Macro with 443MB/s Write Throughput
;
; RRAM has relatively low resistance ratio, so local sense amplifers may be required*
; We assume this macro is duplicated, an thus has local sense amplifiers.
;
; We assume devices have 4x32 such "planes" as a bank from the paper. The row buffer size
; is 32 x 16-bits = 512-bits = 512 bytes across 8 devices. We assume x8 output instead
; of x16.
;
; We assume each device has 4 banks for 1Gb devices
;
; The resulting rank is 1GB, so any number of ranks/channels to increase this to 4GB
; are possible.

; * Highly dependent on material; ISSCC survey ranges from 50k - 1k ohm, up to
;   40M - 200M ohm

; NVMain use CLK and CPUFreq to do the synchronization. The ratio CLK/CPUFreq
