To test with Micron's Verilog model, replace the subtest.vh file in the Micron model
with the subtest.vh file in this directory. This subtest.vh file will include a file
named "nvmain_trace.nvt". Copy the NVMain Verilog trace into the directory with the
Micron model and rename the trace to "nvmain_trace.nvt" and follow the readme.txt
instructions provided with the Micron Verilog model to run verification of DDR-like
protocol simulations. If verification fails, the verilog testbench will stop and 
display an error. If no erors are shown, the verification passes.


Example using the sg125.config :

vlog +define+sg125 +define+den4096Mb ddr3.v
vlog tb.v
vsim tb
run 1ms
